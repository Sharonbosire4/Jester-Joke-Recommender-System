An explorer in the deepest Amazon suddenly finds himself surrounded by a
bloodthirsty group of natives. Upon surveying the situation, he says quietly
to himself, ""Oh God, I'm screwed.""

The sky darkens and a voice booms out, ""No, you are NOT screwed. Pick up that
stone at your feet and bash in the head of the chief standing in front of
you.""

So with the stone he bashes the life out of the chief. Standing above the
lifeless body, breathing heavily looking at 100 angry natives...

There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things
mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily
retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly
impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar
machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine
fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer
who had solved so many of their problems in the past.

The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge
machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular
component of the machine and proudly stated,

""This is where your problem is"".

The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company
received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service.They demanded an
itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:

One chalk mark $1

Knowing where to put it $49,999

It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.

One Sunday morning William burst into the living room and said, ""Dad! Mom! I
have some great news for you! I am getting married to the most beautiful girl
in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan.""

After dinner, William's dad took him aside. ""Son, I have to talk with you.
Your mother and I have been married 30 years.. She's a wonderful wife but she
has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around
with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't
marry her.""

William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating
girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, ""Dianne
said yes! We're getting married in June.""

Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad
news. ""Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I'm awfully sorry about this.""

William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.

""Dad has done so much harm.. I guess I'm never going to get married,"" he
complained. ""Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-
sister.""

His mother just shook her head. ""Don't pay any attention to what he says,
dear. He's not really your father.""

The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He's met by the reception
committee, and after a whirlwind tour he is told that he can enjoy any of the
myriad of recreations available.

He decides that he wants to read all of the ancient original text of the Holy
Scriptures, so he spends the next eon or so learning languages. After becoming
a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every
version of the Bible, working back from most recent ""Easy Reading"" to the
original script.

All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The Angels come running in
only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering,
""An 'R'! The scribes left out the 'R'."" A particularly concerned Angel takes
him aside, offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what does he
mean.

After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, ""It's the letter 'R'. They
left out the 'R'. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!""

Bill & Hillary are on a trip back to Arkansas. They're almost out of gas, so
Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of town. The attendant runs
out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend
from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and
cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye.

As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't
you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease
monkey !'

To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be
pumping gas and he would be the President !'

During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a fortune
teller of some local repute. In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal
ball, the mystic delivered grave news.

""There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare yourself to
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year.""

Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to
compose herself. She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze,
steadied her voice, and asked her question.

""Will I be acquitted?""

A group of managers were given the assignment to measure the height of a
flagpole. So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and
they're falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures - the whole thing
is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what they're trying to do,
walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it
from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.

After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. ""Isn't
that just like an engineer, we're looking for the height and he gives us the
length.""

Two Rednecks were seated at the end of a bar when a young lady seated a few
stools up began to choke on a piece of hamburger. She was turning blue and
obviously in serious respiratory distress. One said to the other, ""That gal
there is having a bad time!"" The other agreed and said ""Think we should go
help?"" ""You bet,"" said the first,and with that, he ran over and said, ""Can you
breathe??"" She shook her head no. He said, ""Can you speak??"" She again shook
her head no. With that, he pulled up her skirt and licked her on the butt.

She was so shocked, she coughed up the obstruction and began to breathe-with
great relief.

The redneck walked back to his friend and said, ""Funny how that hind lick

A lawyer opened the door of his BMW, when suddenly a car came along and hit
the door, ripping it off completely. When the police arrived at the scene, the
lawyer was complaining bitterly about the damage to his precious BMW.

""Officer, look what they've done to my Beeeeemer!!!"", he whined.

""You lawyers are so materialistic, you make me sick!!!"" retorted the officer.
""You're so worried about your stupid BMW, that you didn't even notice that
your left arm was ripped off!!!""

""Oh my gaaaad..."", replied the lawyer, finally noticing the bloody left
shoulder where his arm once was. ""Where's my Rolex???!!!!""

latest speech- recognition software. A representative from the company was
just about ready to start the demonstration and asked everyone in the room to

Just then someone in the back of the room yelled, _""Format C: Return.""_

Someone else chimed in: _""Yes, Return""_

There once was a man and a woman that both got in a terrible car wreck. Both
of their vehicles were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one was hurt.
In thankfulness, the woman said to the man, 'We are both okay, so we should
celebrate. I have a bottle of wine in my car, let's open it.' So the woman got
the bottleout of the car, and handed it to the man. The man took a really big
drink, and handed the woman the bottle. The woman closed the bottle and put it
down. The man asked, 'Aren't you going to take a drink?'

The woman cleverly replied, _'No, I think I'll just wait for the cops to get
here.'_

demands he wear a tie. Discouraged, the guy goes to his car to sulk when
inspiration strikes: He's got jumper cables in the trunk! So he wraps them
around his neck, sort of like a string tie (a bulky string tie to be sure) and
returns to the bar. The maitre d' is reluctant, but says to the guy, ""Okay,

A Panda bear walks into a bar. Sits down at a table and orders a beer and a
double cheeseburger. After he is finished eating, he pulls out a gun and rips
the place with gunfire. Patrons scatter and dive under chairs and tables as
the bear runs out the door. After ensuring that no one is hurt, the bartender
races out the door, and calls after the bear ""What the hell did you do that
for?"" The bear calls back, ""I'm a Panda bear. Look it up in the dictionary.""

The bartender returns, pulls out his dictionary.

A small Asiatic mammal (Ailurus fulgens) having fine soft fur. It is related
to the bears, and inhabits the mountains of Northern India. _Eats shoots and
leaves._

sandwiches from their briefcases and started to eat. The owner became quite
concerned and marched over and told them, _""You can't eat your own sandwiches

_exchanged_ sandwiches.

A teacher is explaining to her class how different languages use negatives
differently. She says, ""In all languages, a positive followed by a negative or
a negative followed by a positive makes a negative. In some languages, two
negatives together make a positive, while in others they make a negative. But
in no language do two positives make a negative.""
